## Tradexa Assignment

An application that has two apps.

1. User with `user` and `Post` model User : first_name, last_name, email, password, username Post : user, text, created_at, updated_at Foreign key relationship exists between User and Post on Model level not on Database level.

2. Products app with `Product` model. Product : name, weight, price, created_at, updated_at Both of the apps should use two different databases. Create a form that an authenticated user can use to create a post.

Since specifications of fields have not been mentioned, I assumed all the fields are mandatory and not blank.
